0|Mine Entrance|Here is where the actual mining began, the main shaft extends east
to where it splits into many smaller shafts following veins of minerals or
valueable crystals.  Cart tracks lead down into rubble, the first evidence
of old cave-ins.|-1|1|-1|-1|
1|A Tunnel|The tunnel of stone is smooth and straight heading deeper into the earth.
Shelves project outward at angles, with water trickling out of some of them
adding to the dampness in the air.|-1|2|-1|0|
2|A Large Cavern|A wide shelf of rock overlooks a pool of water in the center of the room.
Embeded in the walls small stones seem to glow providing a soft light
creating a shimmer in the water falling into the pool from the darkness
above.  Tiny waterfalls seep out of the walls cascading downward to splash
into the pool.  The tunnel continues to the west and the east.|-1|3|-1|1|
3|A Long Tunnel|A trickle of water spreads out in a thin fan pattern on the rock walls
cascading down into a small pool, slowly emptying off to the east.  The
sound of rushing water is heard further down the tunnel.|-1|4|-1|2|
4|An Underwater Lake|A stream poors into the room filling a large lake surrounding an uplifted
stone.  A chest resides upon the wide base of stone made out of bronze.
High up, a large stone stalagtite glows shining light down upon the island
of stone.  At the other end of the room, opposite the stream, the water
continues to flow spilling out down a dark hole. A tunnel leads west and a trail leads south.|-1|-1|5|3|
5|The Main Shaft|About halfway down the main shaft you find the level were most of the
mining had occured.  Many smaller shafts, all caved in of course, run off in
every direction where the ground was stripped of its hidden treasures.  The
main shaft continues even farther down to the east though.|4|6|-1|-1|
6|An Intersection|Several mine shafts converge to this point from above.  Most are small
but one larger one with cart tracts comes from almost straight above and
must be the main shaft.  It continues to here and begins to turn north.  The
singing you thought you may have heard in other parts of the mine
sound like that of a songbird. There are exits in every direction.|9|8|7|5|
7|A Dead End|The tunnel comes to an abrupt stop. The only exit is to the north.|6|-1|-1|-1|
